 * Further exploration
 * 
 * JS uses a system called IEEE 754 to represent numbers. In this system, every number has a special sign bit (0 or 1)
 * to represent whether it's + or -. The standard for floating point arithmetic requires +0 and -0.
 * 
 * The strict equality comparison algorithm (ecma international)
 * The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. Such a comparison is performed as follows:
 * If Type(x) is Number, then
 * If x is +0 and y is âˆ’0, return true.
 * If x is âˆ’0 and y is +0, return true.
